Requirements:
For this programme to run the local machine must have installed python 3.0 or above.
How to run the code:
Import the code to a compiler and then write the command  python3 followed by name and location of file in the 
terminal and then press enter. It will run the code.
For the regularisation.py file, some values goes to infinity, so compiler might through a run time error. To avoid
that use the following command followed by the location of the file: python -W ignore regularisation2.py. 
What will this code do:
You can find 4 .py files in this folder, 1 for each question. Perceptron.py(Q2) is a simple implementation of perceptron,
binaryclassifier.py(Q3) is code which trains three different models for the given three pair of classes and 
prints out the trainig and testing accuracies of each model.1vsRest.py(Q4) trains three binary perceptrons using 1vsrest
approach and do the multiclass classification and at the end prints out the training and testing accuracies of each class.
regularisation.py(Q5) trains the models with different values of regularisation coefficients and print out the accuracies
for every coefficient.
